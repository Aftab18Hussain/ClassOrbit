1. Quality Issues: One of the most common complaints is about the quality of scans. Users often find that the scans may have slanted text, distorted images, or poor resolution, 
			especially when using the free versions of scanning apps.

2. Limited Editing Features: Many scanning apps offer basic editing features like cropping and rotation, but they may lack more advanced editing tools. 
			Users looking for precise editing options may find these apps lacking.

3. Subscription Costs: Some document scanning apps offer free versions with limited features and watermarked scans. To access the full range of features, 
			users are often required to subscribe to a premium or paid plan, which can be expensive over time.

4. Compatibility Issues: Not all scanning apps are compatible with all devices or operating systems. Users may encounter compatibility issues that prevent them from using the app on their specific device.

5. Privacy Concerns: Users may have concerns about the privacy and security of their scanned documents. Storing sensitive documents in a third-party 
			app or cloud service can be a security risk if proper encryption and security measures are not in place.
